# SQL-Capstone

**Overview**: The AirlineDB SQL Capstone Project centers on managing complex airline operations data, including bookings, tickets, flights, aircraft and passengers. By designing and querying a normalized relational schema, the project delivers deep business insights into passenger flows, ticket sales, seat allocation, and flight performance. Analytical focus areas include booking patterns, segmenting ticket and fare conditions, assessing flight utilization and troubleshooting boarding and seating anomalies.

**Key Features**:
-Relational Data Modeling: Developed a robust ER schema linking bookings, passengers, tickets, flight segments, boarding passes, aircraft, and airports.
-Passenger & Ticket Analytics: Enabled multi-passenger bookings and individual ticket analysis, capturing travel and fare behavior at a granular level.
-Flight & Route Analysis: Integrated multiple flight segments per ticket, mapped departure and arrival patterns, and identified primary route trends.
-Seat Allocation/Boarding Logic: Tracked boarding passes and seat assignments, ensuring unique seat distribution and supporting future airline capacity planning.
-Schema-Driven Querying: Applied complex SQL queries (joins, CTEs, subqueries) for insights on ticket sales, flight frequency, seat utilization and delay causes.

**Skills Used**:
-SQL database design and normalization
-Advanced query development: joins, subqueries, CTEs, window functions
-Data validation and consistency checks
-Analytical problem-solving in aviation domain
-ER modeling and relationship management

**Outcome**:
Delivered actionable reports on booking trends, flight occupancy, fare revenue and seat logistics. Enabled business decisions on route scheduling, pricing and passenger management by leveraging data-driven insights. Demonstrated expert-level ability in translating complex airline operations data into meaningful analytics using normalized SQL schema design.
